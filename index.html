              <li>Created a repository:
                <p>
                  I started by having both git and git hub accounts and signing in, then created a repository on git hub and then initialized it on git bash, and started working on it via both of them. My main aim was to create a repository of my own, visible to the public which would give a general idea of what my page is about.
