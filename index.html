<h3>About me</h3>
<p>
    Hello! I'm righteousness by name, a passionate web developer hoping to be a skilled web developer, as talented as my tutor{Sir David}. I recently started learning web dev., and it has been an interesting journey so far. I enjoy creating things that live on the web, my main focus is having a side skill that i can fall back on for future purposes via learning about git, git hub, html, css, java script amongst others. I sincerely hope that i'm able to achieve all these and more!

    Started by having both (git and git hub) accounts and signing in, then created a repository on git hub and then initialized it on git bash, and started working on it via both of them. My main aim was to create a repository of my own, visible to the public which would give a general idea of what my page is about.
